===== A modified Qemu version for the S2E Selective Symbolic Execution Engine ====

See [the parent repository](https://github.com/eurecom-s3/news2e) for more details.

__WARNING__: This repository contains work-in-progress code for a version of
S2E with a current Qemu version.  The code might compile and link, but is for
sure not functional. Lots of stuff is still missing, other stuff is stubbed.
Use only as a study target.
